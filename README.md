# TextFarming
For my second year group project, in a group of five, we worked for an NGO to create a system to provide vital data to (low-literacy) subsistence farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa over low-bandwidth connections (notably phone calls and SMS). I worked on the side communicating with the farmers directly, texting them daily and allowing them to call for more data. We won the Prize for the project most contributing to a Better Future.
